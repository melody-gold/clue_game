# Clue Game

A digital implementation of the board game *Clue*, built as a collaborative class project for CSCI 303 (Software Engineering).

## Overview
This project implements the core mechanics of Clue, including player movement, room entry, suggestions, and accusation logic. The game is built using Java and follows an object-oriented design to model players, cards, rooms, and gameplay flow.

## My Contributions

- Designed and implemented player movement and board interactions
- Worked on overall game architecture and class structure
- Debugging and integration across game components

## Tech Stack
- Java  
- Java Swing

## Notes
This repository is a public version of work I contributed to on a private course repository. Original work was completed collaboratively with a partner.
