LO23P Clue Game

I have most of the outline done! I created a method that takes a boolean 
(T if accusation, F if suggestion which is the default) to handle the logic
for differentiating between the two types of guesses.

I will have to experiment with different ways of implementing, but I think
it's an ok first pass. Aside from that, I have everything thats the same
between the two types of guess put in there.

I need to make it a modal dialog box, too. I should be able to figure it out :)
